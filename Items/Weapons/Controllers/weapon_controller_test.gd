	print("3. Input detection system:")
	print("   - Detects quick clicks vs holds")
	print("   - Routes input to appropriate controller methods")
	print("   - Supports different input modes per weapon")
	print("")
	print("4. Integration points:")
	print("   - Controllers are notified when weapons are equipped/unequipped")
	print("   - Controllers receive update calls every frame")
	print("   - Input is routed through the weapon system")
	print("")
	print("To test:")
	print("1. Pick up different weapons (sword, shield, bow)")
	print("2. Try clicking vs holding mouse buttons")
	print("3. Check the console for controller output")
